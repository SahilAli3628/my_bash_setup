# my_bash_setup
This  repo has the scripts I have written to setup my bash shell. Setup inspired heavily from ChrisTitusTech's "mybash" but modified for my liking

just run ./setup.sh

once installed, please change the terminal font to something from Meslo Nerd Fonts or any other Nerd Fonts

for alacritty, follow the steps mentioned in https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme
